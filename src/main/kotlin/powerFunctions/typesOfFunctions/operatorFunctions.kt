    operator fun String.get(range: IntRange) = substring(range)

    val str = "Peanut candy is delicious. You can't trust anyone who doesn't like peanut candy"
    println(str.length) //Prints length of the complete str String -> 69
    println(str[0..20]) //Prints the String str from character 0 to character 20 inclusive -> Prints: Pa√ßoca is delicious.
